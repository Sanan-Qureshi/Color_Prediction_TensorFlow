# Color_Prediction_TensorFlow
It's super hard to understand TensorFlow alone, and in addition understanding Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for image processing isn't a small feat. It's better to start off with this simple code, where we will understand the CNN in a simple elegant and fun manner. 
I would recommend to run this file in a Google Collab. Now the big and main question is how to design a dataset. You can use MS paint for this purpose; create a 64x64 pixel size environment and then draw a rectangle inside of it and fill it with Red color. I have added 10 rectangle, circle and polygon filled with red color images (in total 30). I have repeated the same procedure for Blue color. I created a 'color' folder and inside created two more folders 'Red' and 'Blue'. Lastly, I created a zip file of 'color' folder, and then uploaded into the collab environment when code prompted me to share.
